title: About

I was born and raised in the city of Lakewood, California. I went to Bellflower High School without any plans of going to college until I started working my first job where I then realized that a college degree would be essential for the type of advancement I wanted within the company. I then started going to Cerritos Community College. I completed my Associates Degree in Business Administration in 2020. After finishing my Associates Degree at Cerritos College I transferred to California State University Dominguez Hills. During my time at CSUDH I have been on the honors list and joined an Honors Society.
